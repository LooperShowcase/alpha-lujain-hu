      Stranger Things is an American science fiction drama television series
      created by the Duffer Brothers, who also serve as showrunners and
      executive producers along with Shawn levy and Dan Cohen. Its first season
      was released on Netflix on July 15, 2016, with the fifth and final season
      renewed in February 2022. Set in the 1980s, primarily in the fictional
      town of Hawkins, Indiana, the series centers on a number of mysterious and
      supernatural events occurring around the town. The Duffer Brothers
      developed Stranger Things as a mix of investigative drama and supernatural
      elements portrayed with horror and childlike sensibilities, while infusing
      references to the pop culture of the 1980s. Several thematic and
      directorial elements were inspired by the works of Steven Spielberg, John
      Carpenter, David Lynch, Stephen King, Wes Craven and H. P. Lovecraft. They
      also took inspiration from experiments conducted during the Cold War and
      conspiracy theories involving secret government experiments. One of
      Netflix's flagship series, Stranger Things has attracted record viewership
      on the streaming platform. The series has been critically acclaimed for
      its characterization, atmosphere, acting, soundtrack, directing, writing,
      and homages to 1980s films. It has received numerous awards and
      nominations, including nominations from the Golden Globe Awards, British
      Academy Television Awards, Directors Guild of America Awards, Writers
      Guild of America Awards, and Grammy Awards, as well as wins from the
      Primetime Emmy Awards, Screen Actors Guild Awards, American Film
      Institute, Critics' Choice Television Awards, and People's Choice Awards.
